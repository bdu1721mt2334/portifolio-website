        <h2 class="statement-two__about">About Me</h2>
        <p class="statement-two__me">I'm Sujan, a passionate and dedicated MCA student at Sathyabama University. With a strong interest in technology and software development, I have honed my skills in Full Stack Development, Python, Java, and CSS. I enjoy building dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications that blend creativity with functionality.

            My journey in programming started with a curiosity for how websites and applications work, which eventually grew into a deep passion for coding and problem-solving. Over time, I have worked on various projects that have helped me gain hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development.
            
            I am always eager to learn and explore new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech world. Whether itâ€™s developing efficient algorithms, designing engaging user interfaces, or optimizing web performance, I strive for excellence in everything I do.
            
            Welcome to my personal space, where I share my knowledge, projects, and experiences. Let's connect and build something amazing together!"**</p>
